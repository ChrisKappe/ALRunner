# alrunner README

AL Runner allows you to run NAV AL object using Alt+R like in good old (actually bad old) C/SIDE.

## Features

Provides a command "ALRunner: Run Selection" which runs the object in the currently selected line, if that is a page or pageextension object

## Requirements

You need to have the Microsoft AL Extension up and running


## Known Issues

Only supports page and pageextension objects as the AL Extension launch config also only allows to set those object types as startup objects
